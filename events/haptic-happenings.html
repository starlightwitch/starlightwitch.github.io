        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Haptic Happenings began as a curatorial goal from Faith Reagin: to bring a collection of youth artwork into the spotlight of Durham's fine art scene. After being awarded funding through the Durham Youth Leadership Fund, Reagin partnered with Constellation Collective, then known as DurmPAC, to bring the exhibition to life.<br><br>Constellation Collective utilized its experience working with youth artists to create an art call rooted in accessibility and creative freedom. Youth artists within Durham were able to request up to $100 in supplies to use in their submission pieces, which could be in any medium they desired. Selected artists attended hands-on workshops centered on taking high quality photos of their work and getting pieces ready-to-hang in the Durham Art Guild's Truist Gallery.<br><br>Haptic Happenings opened to the public on August 6th with an evening gallery reception, culminating in an artists talk moderated by Nori McDuffie. Of nearly fifty submissions, twenty-nine pieces from twenty-two youth artists were on display, covering a range of mediums including painting, collage, wall-scale sculptures, and crocheted textiles. During the exhibition run, a public vote was held for Best in Show, with two runner ups. The results were announced and prize money awarded at the closing ceremony on September 30th.<br><br>- Jett Pavlica</p>
