        <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
        <p>Constellation Collective began as the Durham Powerful Arts Collective, affectionately known as DurmPAC. Formed in the midst of 2020's lockdowns, DurmPAC supported youth artists by removing barriers to creation and bringing their work into the local spotlight. Over four years, we hosted exhibitions, published zines, built digital experiences, and returned over $20,000 in art supplies and programming to our community. Once a team of youth artists ourselves, we are entering new life stages with a refined mission and a reintroduction:<br>We are Constellation Collective.</p>
        <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
        <p>At Constellation Collective, we are creating a network of support and opportunity for artists and aligned organizations in our home community of Durham, North Carolina. We engage in work that honors, celebrates, and preserves young adults (18+) while showcasing the brilliance of the collective and beyond. Our network prioritizes BIPOC and LGBTQ+ identities, which have been historically marginalized, to help rebalance the landscape of creators contributing to our vibrant local arts scene.</p>
        <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
        <p>At Constellation Collective, our partnerships with fellow young adult artists have ensured they have the necessary connections and resources to thrive. All of our stories and artwork are well-documented and honored. We share through joyous ceremonies, inviting collaboration amongst our members as they explore boundlessly and create effortlessly, without hindrance.</p>
