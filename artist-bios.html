            <h1 class="artist-name"><strong>Carlyn Wright-Eakes</strong><br></h1>
            <p class="bio-text">Carlyn Wright-Eakes is an artist and educator from Durham, North Carolina. Her public and community artistic work - from murals to installations and interactive exhibits - center around themes of identity, community, storytelling and social justice. Her abstract paintings are reflections on perspective and mindfulness. At first, one may observe the overall landscape, and move inward to notice intricacies and details potentially overlooked on first glance. In our own lives and in others, we are reminded to attend to the intimacy of moments, portents of small actions, and the beauty of details that, moving too fast, may be entirely missed. Carlyn enjoys turning just about anything into art and uses a variety of mediums from ink, wax, collage, acrylic, book making, jewelry, and mixed media sculpture.<br></p><a class="feature-link" href="carlyn-wright-eakes.html">click here to see Carlyn Wright-Eakes's pentaprism, <em>Graceful Edges</em></a>

            <h1 class="artist-name"><strong>Jim Lee</strong></h1>
            <p class="bio-text">Jim Lee is a multi-dimensional, self-taught artist whose work is heavily influenced by his love of nature, science, psychology, and technology. Working with cameras, scanners, lighting and collections of found and fabricated objects, Jim creates photographic images that range from the darkly mysterious and figurative to the elegantly simple and abstract. He often ventures outside of his photographic practice into three dimensional creations. The work can be beautiful, disturbing, or even whimsical. One rarely leaves one of Jim’s pieces without some question and that is exactly what he wants. His work has been featured in numerous solo and group exhibits and can be found in collections at American Tobacco Campus, Andrew Young Enterprises, Cassilhaus, Duke University Medical Center, and numerous other private collections.<br></p><a class="feature-link" href="jim-lee.html">click here to see Jim Lee's pentaprism, <em>The Oracle</em></a>
