            <p>Pop Box Gallery approached triangle area artists with the pentaprism form, and invited them to apply their creativity to it however they saw fit. Through inspiration and iteration, amazing sculptures were produced. After displaying forty-one of such sculptures in their zero-commission gallery exhibition, Pop Box Gallery partnered with DurmPAC to create a digital zine as an archival companion to the exhibit. To create the zine, we reached out to selected artists with a series of questions about their pieces, their inspirations, and themselves. We are extremely grateful to the artists featured both here and in the exhibit for sharing their art with us.</p>
