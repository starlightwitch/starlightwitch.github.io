                <p class="dpac-text">Sawubona is a greeting used by the Zulu people, which is the largest ethnic group in South Africa. The word roughly translates to “I see you” in English, however, it carries a much deeper meaning in its home community. Sawubona is a greeting that conveys connection and understanding above all else. It’s seeing someone for who they truly are, in all their beauty and all their struggles. It’s seeing their plight, hearing their voice, and promising to be there for them. It opens a dialogue between two people, where each person can feel safe sharing their needs and asking for support. We believe Sawubona perfectly describes our zine’s mission: to be your witness and to stand with you.<br><br>While researching the meaning of Sawubona, we found the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://rochemamabolo.com/about/" style="font-size: 3vh;">Roche Mamabolo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalonenessproject.org/library/interviews/sawubona" style="&quot;font-size: 3vh&quot;;font-size: 3vh;">Orland Bishop</a>&nbsp;to be particularly helpful resources.</p>

                <p class="statement">"I wanted to write a poem inspired by the theme of power and comfort. Growing up in Durham, while Black prosperity was showcased all around me, you hear the story of abundance and growth but not of self-care or taking it easy. As Black folks, we are often pushed to overcome and pursue greatness while overworking ourselves to get to a spot that our 'counterparts' were guaranteed. As you chase after your desires, it’s necessary to rest and slow down to heal yourself as you continue to be great."&nbsp;<br></p>

            <p class="story-body"><em>Swish</em>. The blue paint bleeds into the yellow, but she doesn’t worry about it, moving onto the next stroke. The water was irrelevant anyways, only there to provide a background to the monster in the forefront.<br><br><em>Swish</em>. The monster is leaping out of the canvas now, a gaping jaw showing rows of glimmering teeth. She feels them against her neck, a cold breath. But she moves onto the scales, hardening them beneath her fingers. Jade scales shine as she outlines each with a thin line of black, making each separate from the next. Her mom calls from behind her, dinner only five minutes away. She ignores her and adds to the scales; if she doesn’t get this done now she won’t until tomorrow. <br><br><em>Swish</em>. Claws reach out to her, and she just barely ducks her head to get more paint on her brush. Her hair flies in her face and she’s taken back to a beach, a rocky shoreline in the distance. Blinking, she sees her still unfinished canvas and goes back to the surrounding sea, ignoring the monster in the forefront for now. <br><br>Five minutes have passed but she doesn’t notice, dropping her brush as she hears screams from friends instead. They echo in her ears. Turning, she finds herself on sandy shores, looking into jade eyes, the pupils growing larger the longer she looks at it. Claws reach out to her cheek, cool to the touch. <br><br>And then she falls, her knees scratching against the coarse sand, the screams only intensifying. She sees scarlet streaks and then, silence. <br><br>She awakens, curled up into a ball. Her paintbrush is brushing her nose, a black spot at the tip. Her mother’s face is just in front of her, blowing gently as though to wake her up from a nap. She glances at the painting laying across the stool now, having fallen from its perch on the easel. Her jade eyes gleam and lips curl into a smile. Jagged teeth are all the painter can see as her mom says, “Let’s go eat dinner now, shall we?”<br></p>

                <p class="statement">"Art is a powerful medium and allows insight into the artist’s conscience and thoughts. Family is probably one of the most common origins of comfort, as family, found or blood, dictates one’s idea of home. However, this story takes away the comfort once found with family, specifically the mother in this case. As the story progressed, power was taken from the artist, though they still had the power of their art to see what may have been a traumatic event. Their loss of power led to a loss of comfort, and in this case we see how comfort was not found in family; comfort and power that may have come from familial relations instead came from the artist’s connection to their art. Their art became both their escape from and looking glass into the hostile environment they found themselves in."<br></p>

            <h2 class="written-title" style="color: #fcfaee;border-bottom: 4px solid #355f6b ;">The Woods</h2>
            <p class="story-body">Gabe and I went outside a lot. The house was too stifling, and Mom never noticed when we were there or not anyways. Whenever we stepped out, the forest seemed to greet us. Even if I was dragged along, or Gabe was scowling at the ground, the path remained open. I could only mean to step outside for a moment, yet find myself running inside with Gabe on my heels.&nbsp;Soon, “we’re going outside” became synonymous with “we’re going to the woods.” There wasn’t much to do in the deadbeat town; the woods were the only form of entertainment. Going outside in the winter was the best, when we chased each other and made snow angels or threw mud at each other before heading inside to clean up. <br><br>The forest didn’t have a clear entrance to other, maybe older, individuals, but a tan trail always emerged from the thick trunks whenever we drew near. Squirrels often darted across the grass in the meadow as we approached, returning to their abodes in the trees. Chirps persisted throughout the meadow, but it was never the same bird, changing almost every day. As we got closer to the trees we would crunch over endless fallen leaves in the meadow, regardless of season. But once we stepped inside, it was silent. At least until I tripped over that stupid gnarled root and then the animals would start moving again. <br><br>During the summer, walking in the woods was a dance. One step there, another leaping away. The roots acted with us and turned our small steps into balance contests, and Gabe and I ended up separating as I would bounce away while he stood still. I only went down a few paths though, and then we would find something off trail in the same area to amuse ourselves with. Usually Gabe crouched by the creek, staring at still waters, while I climbed a tree over his head. I would drop acorns on him, but he would never notice until one fell into the water. Only then would he startle and finally look up to see me lounging above him. Once he climbed up the tree and sat next to me, we would have contests to see who could throw the acorns and twigs the furthest. I always won.<br><br>When school started up again, we would bring our homework to do in the trees. The canopy provided us dappled light, but the light was enough until it got too dark to avoid the house anymore. Once Gabe climbed down, I would put my stuff away and we would make the daily walk back to the opening of the trail. I got good at avoiding the gnarled root in the dark soon after the school year started, because Gabe didn’t wait for me when it got that late. If I screamed he would stop, but never otherwise. Mom was annoyed at us since we continued our woodland ventures past the summer, but she never gave us more than a hard look when we sat down for dinner. Dad never cared, only making sure we weren’t trekking dirt into <br>the house. <br><br>Rarely was I ahead of Gabe on the way back to the house. Mom had told us to come back early that day, but it turned out being later than usual when my backpack ripped while I was packing. Gabe helped me clean up, and we started leaving. Gabe wandered over to the stream, a new daily habit of his, but I proceeded to the exit. The trail always welcomed us, but that night there was no movement, no acknowledgement of the home we had found in the tangled roots and chipping bark. The entrance didn’t close, decorated with the same leaves we stepped on during the way in, and the leaves remained still, no breeze in the air. <br><br>Once at the mouth, I realized there were no more footsteps behind me. “Gabe?” As I called into the woods, a wind picked up. But still, no movement, no sounds. “Gabe!” The sun was almost completely behind the house at this point, but I couldn’t leave my brother behind in the woods. <br>But the forest could push me out. I fell back into the dark meadow and the woods closed on me for the first time in months. I shivered from the chill of the night, but I still needed to find Gabe. I could hear the house door opening only a small distance away. I pictured my mom poking her head out only to find a missing son and a daughter sitting on the ground, books spilling out of her bag. But she didn’t poke her head out, only called to come inside. When Gabe still didn’t come from the trees, I retreated into the house. My mom’s hard stare pierced my back, but I retreated to my room and searched for a new backpack to avoid her. When I went downstairs again, she didn’t ask about Gabe, indifferent to his absence. We ate dinner with an empty seat and silence. After eating, I retreated to our room without another word. <br><br>I lay awake in our room after dinner, alone and failing to sleep. Gabe’s bed was closer to the open window, curtains buffeting the breeze. The empty bed taunted me, and when I finally passed out into a dreamless sleep, I woke up more exhausted than the previous day. The bed remained empty as I got ready for school, and was the same when I returned. I tried to bring it up to my mom when I came back the second day without Gabe, but she only looked past me to the forest. We called the police the next day, and spent hours combing through the woods looking for any sign of Gabe. My dad had come home early from work, and my mom had left the house for once. Even after the police gave up after the first day, we spent the weekend going further and further into the forest, leaving behind a trail of acorns to make sure we didn’t get lost. Each day ended with me curling into my bed, avoiding looking at Gabe’s bed as tears streamed down my face. My parents stopped after a week.&nbsp;<br><br>I still went to the forest everyday, leaving gifts in every tree cranny. Apples and oranges would be gone when I returned each day, but books remained untouched after weeks. I would stay and listen to the squirrels until they stopped scurrying, only leaving once I could see Orion’s Belt above me. Mom stopped calling for me to return after the first week since Gabe disappeared, and Dad was home even less than before. <br>Days turned into weeks turned into months turned into years. Gabe’s bed remained empty but his desk never gathered dust with how often I wiped it. I brought gifts to the forest still, but now there were treats for the squirrels and birds that would wander by the trail. Acorns started lining the paths and occasionally feathers would find themselves landing at my feet. Gabe’s absence was soon filled by the forest animals, though I still brought books to leave for weeks at a time before I returned them to my room. They would look well-worn, but that was mainly due to the mud stains that appeared each time. <br><br>At the beginning, whenever people asked where Gabe was, my parents said he was staying with relatives out-of-town for medical reasons. By now, everyone knows not to ask me about my brother, it’s not like I would give them an answer anyways. Close to the start of yet another school year and more teachers missing “Gabe Flannery” on their rosters, the forest grew quiet. Even when the sun was at its highest, a time for chittering and rushing water to strike my ears, the most noise was from the squirrels starting to hoard their acorns for the fall. The silent nights turned into repressing spaces and I retreated to the house every night earlier each night until I stopped going to the forest altogether. If it wasn’t going to give me the comfort I needed over the last few years, I wouldn’t give it my time. The forest was taunting me for what I had lost. I refused to let it win. <br><br>However, that didn’t last more than a week; staying in an empty room was worse than going to a silent forest. I hadn’t gone near the window during my self-isolation. If I had, maybe I would’ve noticed the squirrels leaving acorn mounds in the meadow, and feathers floating up to the windowsill. When I went outside, the forest didn’t pull me but pushed me. The acorns led to another entrance near the neighboring house, twined branches forming an arch. <br><br>Gabe and I used the one path behind our house because it was easy to hear Mom call us for dinner, and easy to run back to if we needed. Although I entered at noon, this new path was darker and smelled sour like rotting grass, not the homely earth of the other trail. Squirrels that followed me went around my ankles and pushed me into the woods. There was no root to trip over, and no running creek in the foreground. Gabe and I never knew about this path because it was too silent to not bring chills. Although it had rained twice in the past week, the path was made of cracked dirt and weeds growing along the edges. <br><br>I saw the jacket first. It was dark blue and almost faded into the trees, but it was scrounged up enough to stand out among the smooth trail. He never used to take it off, even when it started getting too small once we got to middle school. Around a bend in the path, I saw a shoelace adorned with a ladybug pin we had gotten during a field trip once. I went further into the path with each new item I found, until I held his shoes, jacket, and clothes. <br><br>I stopped at a clearing, the center of which held his backpack. Unlike the clothing in my arms, it looked clean, not an inch of dirt on it. It was as full as it was the last time I saw Gabe. This time, the forest pushed me into the clearing and I opened the bag, hands shaking. His books were in the ever pristine condition they were always in, never one to let mud to get on them. Squirrels lined the edges of the clearing, watching as I closed the bag again and set the clothes down. There were no other remnants from that day in the woods, nothing else I could say was Gabe’s. Putting on his bag didn’t help as I remembered our adventures. But when I walked back to the entrance and to our house, the forest was moving again. Birds chirped and I heard the creek running. Exiting the woods, I turned back to find no arch, only a space between the trees. The acorns in the meadow were gone, and squirrels ran into the woods and hoarded acorns just like the week before. I carried whatever was left of Gabe, but no one else noticed. Mom was as silent as ever, Dad still wasn’t home. Dumping everything on his desk relieved myself of the weight. Looking at the empty bed, it was about time I stripped it and moved it. It wasn’t going to be filled anytime soon.<br></p>

                <p class="statement" style="width: 100%;">"Childhood is always an interesting concept to explore due to the openness and innocence children possess. As in the story, the narrator and her brother make the nearby woods their new safe haven and a place to escape the numbness of adulthood; it becomes a place of comfort. However, as is common in many scenarios, trauma can take away comfort that may have previously existed, and the people in charge no longer have power over their situation. Yet, sometimes the people involved can reclaim their power over something and once again find comfort in the thing that took it away in the first place. This is a story about moving on and refinding your home when it’s been taken away from you, and in a sense, reclaiming your comfort in a situation you were once powerless."<br></p>

This is one way that I enjoy critiquing the history of the art I love and consume. This piece generally explores the beautiful, difficult, impossible journey of language-learning. It also illustrates the conflict of this pursuit as an attempt at connecting back with one’s original culture and trying to define a new identity, especially as a member of the African Diaspora whose language, culture and even genetic makeup were decided for them.

This level of intimacy with myself has been incredibly daunting. In the past, it has felt as if I am painting a stranger, unable to find recognizable features. I was incapable, and perhaps unwilling, to allow the necessary level of familiarity with myself. This painting is my latest approach to this struggle, and my first step forward.
