Growing up in Durham, while Black prosperity was showcased all around me, you hear the story of abundance and growth but not of self-care or taking it easy. As Black folks, we are often pushed to overcome and pursue greatness while overworking ourselves to get to a spot that our 'counterparts' were guaranteed. As you chase after your desires, it’s necessary to rest and slow down to heal yourself as you continue to be great."&nbsp;<br></p>

            <p style="color: #e0e0e0;"><em>Swish</em>. The blue paint bleeds into the yellow, but she doesn’t worry about it, moving onto the next stroke. The water was irrelevant anyways, only there to provide a background to the monster in the forefront.<br><br><em>Swish</em>. The monster is leaping out of the canvas now, a gaping jaw showing rows of glimmering teeth. She feels them against her neck, a cold breath. But she moves onto the scales, hardening them beneath her fingers. Jade scales shine as she outlines each with a thin line of black, making each separate from the next. Her mom calls from behind her, dinner only five minutes away. She ignores her and adds to the scales; if she doesn’t get this done now she won’t until tomorrow. <br><br><em>Swish</em>. Claws reach out to her, and she just barely ducks her head to get more paint on her brush. Her hair flies in her face and she’s taken back to a beach, a rocky shoreline in the distance. Blinking, she sees her still unfinished canvas and goes back to the surrounding sea, ignoring the monster in the forefront for now. <br><br>Five minutes have passed but she doesn’t notice, dropping her brush as she hears screams from friends instead. They echo in her ears. Turning, she finds herself on sandy shores, looking into jade eyes, the pupils growing larger the longer she looks at it. Claws reach out to her cheek, cool to the touch. <br><br>And then she falls, her knees scratching against the coarse sand, the screams only intensifying. She sees scarlet streaks and then, silence. <br><br>She awakens, curled up into a ball. Her paintbrush is brushing her nose, a black spot at the tip. Her mother’s face is just in front of her, blowing gently as though to wake her up from a nap. She glances at the painting laying across the stool now, having fallen from its perch on the easel. Her jade eyes gleam and lips curl into a smile. Jagged teeth are all the painter can see as her mom says, “Let’s go eat dinner now, shall we?”<br></p>

Family is probably one of the most common origins of comfort, as family, found or blood, dictates one’s idea of home. However, this story takes away the comfort once found with family, specifically the mother in this case. As the story progressed, power was taken from the artist, though they still had the power of their art to see what may have been a traumatic event. Their loss of power led to a loss of comfort, and in this case we see how comfort was not found in family; comfort and power that may have come from familial relations instead came from the artist’s connection to their art. Their art became both their escape from and looking glass into the hostile environment they found themselves in.<br></p>
