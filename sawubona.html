        <h2 style="color: #f8f9fa;max-width: 600px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Mission</span></h2>
        <p style="color: #f8f9fa;font-size: 24px;max-width: 600px;">Sawubona is the first project from a newly formed group known as the Durham Powerful Arts Collective. As our name implies, we believe that art is a powerful form of expression that can bring healing and change. In the midst of a devastating global pandemic, America's continued struggle with racism from the individual to the systemic level, and an election that rocked the nation, we realized that some members of our community have a lot to say with nowhere to say it. We've set out to amplify these voices by providing a space for artists that centers BIPOC and LGBTQ+ people, with a theme that encourages them to explore and share two of the most important and most fleeting aspects of one's life in 2020: power and comfort.<br></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;color: #f8f9fa;max-width: 600px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Theme</span></h2>
        <p style="color: #f8f9fa;font-size: 24px;margin-bottom: 8px;max-width: 600px;">How does your power give you comfort, and how does your comfort give you power? This question is the main theme of Sawubona. We invited artists to reflect on how these aspects of life interact with each other throughout their creative process. To stir inspiration and introduce you to our theme, we've put together these guiding questions:<br></p>
        <ul style="color: #f8f9fa;font-size: 20px;text-align: left;padding-left: 50px;margin-bottom: 32px;padding-right: 30px;max-width: 600px;">
            <li style="max-width: 600px;">What does power mean to you?&nbsp;</li>
            <li style="max-width: 600px;">What does comfort mean to you?&nbsp;</li>
            <li style="max-width: 600px;">Where do you get power from? Does your power bring you comfort?</li>
            <li style="max-width: 600px;">Where do you find comfort? Does your comfort empower you?</li>
            <li style="max-width: 600px;">How have you used your power? How do you want to use it?</li>
            <li style="max-width: 600px;">Where do you see power around you? What form does it take?&nbsp;</li>
            <li style="max-width: 600px;">How do you use power to bring comfort to yourself or others, or how would you?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;color: #f8f9fa;max-width: 600px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Meaning of Sawubona</span></h2>
        <p style="color: #f8f9fa;font-size: 24px;max-width: 600px;">Sawubona is a greeting used by the Zulu people, which is the largest ethnic group in South Africa. The word roughly translates to “I see you” in English, however, it carries a much deeper meaning in its home community. Sawubona is a greeting that conveys connection and understanding above all else. It’s seeing someone for who they truly are, in all their beauty and all their struggles. It’s seeing their plight, hearing their voice, and promising to be there for them. It opens a dialogue between two people, where each person can feel safe sharing their needs and asking for support. We believe Sawubona perfectly describes our zine’s mission: to be your witness and to stand with you.<br></p>
        <p style="color: #f8f9fa;font-size: 24px;max-width: 600px;margin-bottom: 32px;">While researching the meaning of Sawubona, we found the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://rochemamabolo.com/about/" target="_blank" style="color: #e5c4d6;max-width: 600px;">Roche Mamabolo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalonenessproject.org/library/interviews/sawubona" target="_blank" style="color: #e5c4d6;max-width: 600px;">Orland Bishop</a>&nbsp;to be particularly helpful resources.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;color: #f8f9fa;max-width: 600px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So What's a Zine?</span></h2>
        <p style="color: #f8f9fa;font-size: 24px;max-width: 600px;">Historically, zines typically contain unpopular opinions and radical thoughts. In the 1970s, the punk rock scene began using the medium as a way to promote bands and share their anti-authoritarian message. Feminism found its way into the zine scene through the riot grrrls, an underground feminist punk movement. Bands like Bikini Kill used zine publications and their message of empowerment to encourage women to venture out and try new hobbies such as making music. Zines are thriving in today’s digital age as the internet has made it virtually free to create and distribute publications with the use of a link. The number of consistent publications has increased with time, and zines cover more genres and themes than ever before. Digital zines are able to include more forms of art like auditory and video mediums, which allow for more creative expression.<br></p>
